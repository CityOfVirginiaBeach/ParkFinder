ParkFinder
==========

Find parks around the City of Virginia Beach by location and amenity.

This app is written in Appcelerator's Titanium Framework and is targeted towards iOS and Android.  Feel free to expand/enhance the app and add additional platforms.

Once the code reaches a certain point of completeness we will release the app to the iOS and Google app stores.

Happy coding!!
